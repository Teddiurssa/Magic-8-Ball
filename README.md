# Magic-8-Ball Project

Basic JavaScript and JQuery to make this project.

I learned: 
* Objects, along with properties, methods, and functions.
* Loops, arrays, and how they working them together.
* Math.random() to learn how to make my array into a answer picker.
* Working in the DOM and syncing JavaScript to my HTML and CSS
